# Mario Tic Tac Toe

Toy project of a backend engineer pretending to be a frontender for a while ðŸŽ­

Had lots of fun while learning some things along the way: 

- [x] React + Vite
- [x] React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect` and `useCallback`
- [x] Custom hook `useStrategy`
- [x] Local storage
- [x] Testing with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [x] Linting with eslint + [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) + [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) + [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)
